solutions to python async comprehension exercises

0. Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments.

    The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10. Use the random module.

1. Import async_generator from the previous task and then write a coroutine called async_comprehension that takes no arguments.

    The coroutine will collect 10 random numbers using an async comprehensing over async_generator, then return the 10 random numbers.
