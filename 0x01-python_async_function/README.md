solutions to python async exercises

0. Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (max_delay, with a default value of 10) named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.

    Use the random module.

1. Import wait_random from the previous python file that you’ve written and write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

    wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values). The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using sort() because of concurrency
